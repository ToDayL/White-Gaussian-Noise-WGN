# White-Gaussian-Noise-WGN
This is the simple implement to get a random number of White Gaussian Noise. 

Use Box-Muller to generate White Gaussian Noise.

See one of the result in noise.txt and noise.jpg show the probability density function(PDF).

In the test v=3 and sigma=1.

To Use this function, you need to set seed for random in main function.
